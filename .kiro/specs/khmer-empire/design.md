# Khmer Empire Feature Design Document

## Overview

The Khmer Empire feature will be implemented as a dedicated section within the existing Cambodian culture website. It will provide an immersive, educational experience through four main interactive components: Timeline, Rulers, Territory Maps, and Achievements Gallery. The design emphasizes visual storytelling, historical accuracy, and responsive user experience across all devices.

## Architecture

```

### Data Flow Architecture

The application will use a centralized state management approach with React Context for sharing data between components:

```
KhmerEmpireContext
├── timelineData (events, periods)
├── rulersData (ruler profiles, achievements)
├── territoryData (boundaries, cities by period)
├── achievementsData (categorized achievements)
└── uiState (active filters, selected periods)
```

## Data Models

### Timeline Event Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  date: number, // CE year
  title: string,
  description: string,
  category: 'political' | 'military' | 'cultural' | 'architectural',
  significance: 'major' | 'moderate' | 'minor',
  relatedRulers: string[], // ruler IDs
  relatedAchievements: string[], // achievement IDs
  coordinates?: { lat: number, lng: number }
}
```

### Ruler Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  reignStart: number,
  reignEnd: number,
  dynasty: string,
  biography: string,
  achievements: string[],
  territorialChanges: string[],
  images: {
    portrait?: string,
    artifacts: string[]
  },
  relatedEvents: string[]
}
```

### Territory Model
```javascript
{
  period: string, // e.g., "9th-century", "peak-expansion"
  boundaries: GeoJSON.Feature,
  majorCities: {
    name: string,
    coordinates: [number, number],
    significance: string,
    period: string
  }[],
  description: string
}
```
